# 3D-Block-Breaker
This is a COMP410/510(Computer Graphics) final project.

3D-Block-Breaker is a game where the player destroys incoming blocks with balls. Extra balls can be picked up if the player successfully hits them. Two camera/shooting modes exist. Click 'X' to change between these modes.

The game is implemented using C++/OpenGL/GLUT/GLM

#### The controls :

SPACE      : Shoot the balls.
R          : Reset the game if it is over (There exists a cube at the z = 0 plane).
